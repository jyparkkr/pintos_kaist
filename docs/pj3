vm_entry
=========


---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>>new or changed 'struct'

We newly made two files pintos_kaist/src/vm/page.h, pintos_kaist/src/vm/page.c
In pintos/src/vm/page.h, there is newly made struct vm_entry
which is composed with below.
    
struct vm_entry{
	uint8_t type; /* type for VM_BIN, VM_FILE, VM_ANON */
	void *vaddr; /* virtual page number that vm_entry manages*/
	bool writable; /* If True writable on corresponding address, If false not*/

	bool is_loaded; /* flag that tells us if is_loaded on physical memory */
	struct file* file; /* file that is mapped with virtual address */
	
	/* Will be used at Memory Mapped File*/
	struct list_elem mmap_elem; /* mmap list element */
	
	size_t offset; /* offset of file that will read*/
	size_t read_bytes; /* data size written on virtual page */
	size_t zero_bytes; /* left bytes that will be filled with 0*/
	
	/* Will be used on Swapping*/
	size_t swap_slot; /* swap slot */

	/* Will be used on ‘struct for vm_entries’*/
	struct hash_elem elem; /* hash table Element */
};

There is also a change at struct thread in pintos_kaist/src/threads/thread.h
/*For pj3 virtual memory*/
struct hash vm; /* Hashtable for virtual address space that thread owns*/
added.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> Brieﬂy describe your implementation of vm_entry

Every pages will have one vm_entry.
It saves file pointer, offset, size of each page.
When first load the program, allocate vm_entry on each page of virtual address space
When run program
->search the page table
->when page fault occurs, search vm_entry correspond to virtual address
--->If virtual address not in vm_entry, Segmentation fault
--->If vm_entry exist
----->allocate page frame
----->load page refer to the file pointer, offset, size and so on in the vm_entry
----->update page table

Also made many functions that deal with vm_entries.
void vm_init (struct hash *vm);   //initializes hash table vm
bool insert_vme (struct hash *vm, struct vm_entry *vme); //insert vme into vm
bool delete_vme (struct hash *vm, struct vm_entry *vme); //delete vme from vm
struct vm_entry *find_vme (void *vaddr); //find vm_entry using address *vaddr
void vm_destroy (struct hash *vm); // destroy hashtable vm



Demand paging
=============

---- ALGORITHMS ----


>> Brieﬂy describe your implementation of vm_entry

1. 
In pintos_kaist/src/userprog/process.c there is 
static bool
load_segment (struct file *file, off_t ofs, uint8_t *upage,
              uint32_t read_bytes, uint32_t zero_bytes, bool writable)
Here, loading segment of ELF format file on process virtual address space take place.
This is modified.
The part loading memory on virtual address space deleted.
Instead, vm_entry initializing is added.
allocate vm_entry structure, initialize field values, insert vm_entry to hashtable.


2. 
In pintos_kaist/src/userprog/process.c there is
static bool setup_stack (void **esp)

There are some functionalities added.
create 4KB vm_entry
initialize the field values of created vm_entry
insert to hashtable vm


3.
In pintos_kaist/src/userprog/syscall.c
There are functions for checking validity.
When checking, it previously just checked the validity of address.
From now on, chaged check_address function and 
added check_string, check_buffer function will check more deeply.
Even the address is valid, we will check whether vm_entry correspond to the address/buffer/string exist.


4.
In pintos_kaist/src/userprog/exception.c
There is static void page_fault (struct intr_frame *f) which manages page fault.
Previously, segmentation fault occurs and kill(-1) the process 
if there is an error on permission and address validity test.
From now on, if the addr is valid, search for vm_entry.
If there is, allocate pages, load from file to physical memory, set up page table 


5.
The process of allocate pages, load from file to physical memory, set up page table takes place by
bool handle_mm_fault (struct vm_entry *vme)  in pintos_kaist/src/userprog/process.c
This is newly added function. If handle_mm_fault is called,
first allocate physical memory, manage vm_entry by its type using switch case.
If type is VM_BIN, load to physical memory by 
bool load_file (void* kaddr, struct vm_entry *vme) in pintos_kaist/src/vm/page.c .
Then, map physical page and virtual page 
by static bool
install_page (void *upage, void *kpage, bool writable) in pintos_kaist/src/userprog/process.c


---- RATIONALE ----

every test passed related to Demanding pages.
I tested by make check on pintos_kaist/src/vm.
The result was 28 of 109 tests failed, which is the same value with lab pdf.

Memory Mapped File
=============
>> new or changed 'struct'
1. For mapid, datatype(typedef int mapid_t) and macro (#define MAPID_ERROR) added
2. In struct thread, mapid_t next_mapid is added. This starts from 0 and it implies next mapid number.
3. struct mmap_file is added on page.h
struct mmap_file {
    int mapid;
    struct file* file;		/* file pointer in mem */
    struct list_elem elem;	/* for thread's mmap_list */
    struct list vme_list;	/* its vm entry list */
};


>> Added global variables


---- ALGORITHMS ----


Swapping
=============
>> new or changed 'struct'
1. size_t swap_slot was added on vm_entry to show its swapped entry on swap disk if it is swapped out.

2. struct page  is added on page.h
struct page {
	void *kaddr;			/* physical addr of page */
	struct vm_entry *vme;	/* points vm_entry linked with physical page */
	struct thread *thread;	/* points thread_current */
	struct list_elem lru;	/* for connection with lru_list */
};



>> Added global variables
1. In frame.c global variables for swap policy was added.
struct list lru_list;
struct lock lru_list_lock;
struct list_elem *lru_clock;
was added on this feature.
Although name of global variables include lru, its swapping policy I choose to use is clock algorithm.
lru_clock is clock arm of this algorithm.

2. size of swap slot (#define SWAP_SLOT_SIZE 4096)  is added on swap.c to calculate number of block sector
needed for one swap slot and to calculate initial bitmap(for swap disk management) size.
